    <h1> hello</h1>
    <h2> from your friend</h2>

    <p> What to do this up-coming July as Covid is still here? Below are some nice things as suggestions to get through this stay-at-home period:</p>
    <p> Most of us probably chill at home, some nice thing to do is read a book with your dog (if you owned one)</p>
    <p> Learn a new skill e.g. programing for website, python for anlytics, etc.</p>
    <p> Clean up the house! Perfect time to freshen up the place you stay at most of the time </p>
    <p> Or...you can check out the video below and enjoy with a nice cup of coffee...</p>
    <p> Stay safe and healthy!</>
